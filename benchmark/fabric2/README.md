# Benchmarking Guide for Fabric

This folder contains the ncesessary scripts to benchmark Hyperledger Fabric v2+. We tested it with Fabric v2.3.1.

Steps to run the benchmark:

1. Prepare Fabric on each node: clone [Fabric code](https://github.com/hyperledger/fabric), build the binaries and the Docker images.

Make sure you have the following binaries in ``build/bin``:

```
$ ls build/bin/
configtxgen  configtxlator  cryptogen  discover  idemixgen  orderer  osnadmin  peer
```

Then copy these binaries in a ``bin`` folder under 	``benchmark/fabric2/``. This repository includes the binaries for x86/64 and aarch64 (see [bin-x64-v2.3.1](bin-x64-v2.3.1) and [bin-arm64-v2.3.1](bin-arm64-v2.3.1)).

2. Prepare blockbench:

-> change [env.sh](env.sh) to match your setup. 

-> run [setup_all.sh](setup_all.sh) to start fabric

-> run benchmark with [run-fabric.sh](run-fabric.sh).


## Prerequisites
* _docker_  with version `18.06.3-ce` or later.
* _python_  with version `2.7.x`
* _golang_  with version `1.14.x`
* _node_  with version `12.13.x`
* On each peer node, pull the docker images `docker pull hyperledger/fabric-ccenv:latest`. 

# Preparation
__NOTE__: The preparation steps are all done for once. 
## SDK
```
npm install
```
## Artifacts
```
CHANNEL="testchannel"
NETWORK_DIR="test"
PEER_COUNT=2

python prepare.py ${NETWORK_DIR} $CHANNEL 500 3 slave-30 slave-31 slave-32 ${PEER_COUNT} slave-4 slave-5
```
* The above cmd prepares for a network with 500 txns per block, 3 orderers (slave-30 slave-31 slave-32), `PEER_COUNT` peers (slave-4, slave-5), and a channel named as `$CHANNEL`.
* The generated artifacts are in `$NETWORK_DIR`. 
* Each peer belongs to different orgs. (Each org has a single peer. ) But all orderers belong to the same org. 
* Orderers employ Raft and the tls MUST be on for Raft. 

## Others
Update `MY_DATA_DIR` in _config.py_ to a directory with the write access. 

# Spin-up
```
# A fresh restart
python network.py ${NETWORK_DIR} on
```
Spin up the Fabric network as specfied in `${NETWORK_DIR}`.

# Channel/chaincode Setup
## Channel Initialization
```
./setup_channel.sh ${NETWORK_DIR} ${CHANNEL}
```
The following logs are normal:
```
2020-12-16 19:31:16.792 +08 [channelCmd] InitCmdFactory -> INFO 001 Endorser and orderer connections initialized
2020-12-16 19:31:16.831 +08 [cli.common] readBlock -> INFO 002 Expect block, but got status: &{NOT_FOUND}
```

## Contract Deployment
```
CC_NAME=fabcar
ALL_ORG=""
for i in $(seq ${PEER_COUNT})
do
   ALL_ORG="$ALL_ORG 'Org${i}MSP.peer'"
done

function join_by { local d=$1; shift; local f=$1; shift; printf %s "$f" "${@/#/$d}"; }
ENDORSE_POLICY="AND($(join_by , $ALL_ORG))"
# The result is AND('Org1MSP.peer','Org2MSP.peer',...), which requires for all orgs' endorsements.

INIT_FCN=InitLedger
TEST_QUERY_FCN=QueryAllCars # An optional query to verify the entire deployment process.

./deployCC.sh ${NETWORK_DIR} ${CHANNEL} ${CC_NAME} "${ENDORSE_POLICY}" ${INIT_FCN} ${TEST_QUERY_FCN}
```

If the deployment is successfuly, the query results shall be displayed.

If encountering the following log during the deployment, remove docker images of previously deployed chaincodes as described later.
```
Error: endorsement failure during invoke. response: status:500 message:"error in simulation: failed to execute transaction bd32606273a80acf4736bacf03b122a39fd5e6996919f77c4cf32be95e106e84: could not launch chaincode fabcar_1.0:c302ddec384cce226322fc4a6629127d876f0ebbd91a6093cea0a829231b1e09: chaincode registration failed: container exited with 0" 
```

# Invoke 
```
INVOKE_FCN=ChangeCarOwner
INVOKE_ARGS="CAR4 RPC"
INVOKE_ORG_ID=1
MODE=open_loop # Other values assume for the closed-loop invocation. 
node invoke.js ${NETWORK_DIR} ${INVOKE_ORG_ID} ${MODE} ${CHANNEL} ${CC_NAME} ${INVOKE_FCN} ${INVOKE_ARGS}
```

# Query
```
QUERY_FCN=queryCar
QUERY_ARGS=CAR4
QUERY_ORG_ID=2 # Queried on the peer of Org2 with its admin
node query.js ${NETWORK_DIR} ${QUERY_ORG_ID} ${CHANNEL} ${CC_NAME} ${QUERY_FCN} ${QUERY_ARGS}
```
If correct, one may observe RPC is now the owner of CAR4. 

# Register for block events
Start a long-running process to monitor blocks and retrieve internal transactions. 
```
REGISTER_ORG_ID=1
node register_blk_listener.js ${NETWORK_DIR} ${REGISTER_ORG_ID} ${CHANNEL} 
```
Try a number of above invocations with the monitor service on. 

# Turn-off
```
python network.py ${NETWORK_DIR} off
```
Peer and orderer logs are preserved until the next spin-up.

# Collect Measurements from peer logs
__NOTE__: Assume to have logged in the peer terminal. Approach me (RPC) if you are unfamiliar about the metrics. 
```
STATRT_BLK=2 # Inclusive. If undefined STATRT_BLK=0
END_BLK=10 # Exclusive. If undefined END_BLK=infinity
# measure_block.py will get the peer log path from config.py.
python measure_block.py ${STATRT_BLK} ${END_BLK}
```

# Remove images of deployed chaincodes on peer nodes
__NOTE__:This step is unnecessary unless the chaincode is changed. 
```
DOCKER_IMAGE_IDS=$(docker images | awk '($1 ~ /dev-*/) {print $3}')
if [ -z "$DOCKER_IMAGE_IDS" -o "$DOCKER_IMAGE_IDS" == " " ]; then
   echo "---- No images available for deletion ----"
else
   docker rmi -f $DOCKER_IMAGE_IDS
fi
```
